# World_Weather_Analysis

## Introduction
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize APIs that grasp real time information and produce them into usable results. 

## Summary
This analysis was performed for the PlanMyTrip app. The app had some design recommendations that I put into place through the use of the Google Maps Directions API and the OpenWeatherMap API. Once the design was in place, beta testers came in to try out the app for themselves to see if the recommendations were favorable.

This project focused on obtaining real time weather data, and then utilizing this weather data for tip planning purposes. We were able to do the following:
  - Retrieve Weather Data
  - Create Customer Travel Destination Maps after obtaining their desired minimum and maximum temperatures of their destinations
  - Create a Travel Itinerary Map that included hotels and exact latitude and longitude information of multiple cities at once

## Conclusion
The analysis was successful, and both snapshots and dataframes are viewable in the attached folders.
